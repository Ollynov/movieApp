MVP V1. Deadline 3:30
Our movie app will allow a user to enter homescreen and see title,
picture of a random movie, the rating of that movie (number from 1-10), and two buttons under photo:
"Im feeling lucky" button will just reload the page
"Submit movie" will take you to the submit.html (blank html page for MVP)

SETUP
-package.json √
- npm install dependencies √
- install eslint √
- file structure process file, compiled file, (views file holding components), server config file, data.json file

RENDERING
index.html (homepage)
submit.html

NOTES:
- render first movie to homepage (image, title, rating number)
- render submit page
- initial movie image can be stored in a json file rather than database

submit.html
User sees a brief text overview of how legit of a movie they need to submit

 Looking decent as well

> This material was originally posted [here](http://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management). It is reproduced here for posterities sake.

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Awesome movie recommendation.

## Sub-Heading ##
  Families who decide to "watch a movie," and then spend more time browsing options and arguing than actually enjoying a good movie.

## Summary ##
  Click the "get movie" button and get an awesome movie recommendation. The rule is that on each click of the button the entire family must vote, and if 75% vote for a particular option then that's that! Grab the popcorn and enjoy.

## Problem ##
  Families typically decide to watch a movie together in the evening when they finally have a couple hours of free time to enjoy with everyone together. Life is hectic, and the last thing they need is another decision to make. Unfortunately we are now bombarded by not only different movies (many of which suck), but also have different tools (Netflix, amazon, etc), and this will often lead families into "paralysis by analysis."

## Solution ##
   This app solves the "paralysis by analysis" problem by bringing the simplicity back in movie watching and only giving you one button to click.

## Quote from You ##
  "The implications here are breakthrough... no longer will families suffer by having to argue and sift through thousands of movie options. We're making movie-watching great again."

## How to Get Started ##
  "Simply click on the "get movie" button and you will get a movie option presented to you."

## Customer Quote ##
  "I hate having to decide, especially at the end of the day when all I want to do is relax. Now all I need to do is click a button and brace myself for an amazing movie-watching experience"
